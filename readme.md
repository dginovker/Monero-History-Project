# The Monero History Project 

A new name due to a conflict with the old one 

The history of Monero is well documented across several different places, and the most complete post is probably that of [David Latapie](https://forum.getmonero.org/20/general-discussion/211/history-of-monero) found on getmonero.org. While this post documents the history of Monero and key events, it does not contain the detail that's currently hidden away in barren IRC chats...

## The Goal

1) Group and upload raw IRC chatlogs to appropriate [Monero repositories](https://github.com/monero-project)

2) Parse key discussions and meetings from the logs and upload to the [Meta Repository](https://github.com/monero-project/meta)

3) Summarise key events and create blogs on the [Monero Site](https://repo.getmonero.org/monero-project/monero-site) repository

4) Archive history!
